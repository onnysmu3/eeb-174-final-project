## FINAL PROJECT - EEB C234

**THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENUS NEOTRYGON AROUND THE WORLD BASED ON BOLDSYSTEM DATABASE**

I downloaded two datasets, which are 1). list of the distribution area of *Neotrygon*, 2). sequence database of *Neotrygon*. 

[The datasets were donwloaded from BOLD System database]:http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/databases

In my presentation, I would like to give brief explanation about my datasets by using Markdown, and then for final result I would like to make a Latex doc.

Then before I give some questions regarding my dataset, I would like to show my dataset to the audience in order to assure that the dataset is correct.

	**How can we do that?**

## For the items in dataset-1:

	**QUESTIONS #1**:
	a. How many institution did store the species? Show the list of institutions.
	b. And how many speciments are stored in each instituion? Show the list of institutions
	c. Which institution stores the highest number of the species? an
	d. How many species are in the database? Show the list of species and the number of speciment record.
	e. Make a new .txt file called new_database.txt and save all information above on the new file

	**QUESTION #2**:
	By using iPython: make a dictionary which contains "Species_name | Institution_storing | Country | region"

	**QUESTION #3**:
	By using R studio, make a histogram of the species record in each institution.


## For items in dataset-2:

	**QUESTIONS**:
	a. How much is the percentage of AT_content in every single sequence?
	b. How much is the percentage of GC_content in every single sequence?
	c. How is the ratio of AT and GC content in every single sequence?
	d. Where is the species which has the highest AT_content from?
	e. Where is the species which has the highest AT_content from?
