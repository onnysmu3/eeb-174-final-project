title = {DNA barcoding of elasmobranchs from Indian Coast and its reliability in delineating geographically widespread specimens},
abstract = {Identification of elasmobranchs by conventional taxonomy is difficult due to similarities in morphological characters. Species-specific molecular markers are good choice for identifying species irrespective of it’s life stage. Recently, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene got global recognition as a barcode gene to discriminate all animals up-to species level. In this study, mitochondrial COI partial gene was used to develop DNA barcodes for 18 species of elasmobranchs (10 species of sharks and 8 species of rays). The COI barcodes clearly
distinguished all the species with high interspecific distance values than intraspecific values. The average interspecific and intraspecific distance values are 8.6% and 0.3% for sharks, respectively and 12.4% and 0.63% for rays, respectively using K2P method. The Neighbor- Joining tree showed distinct clusters shared by the species of same genera. The COI barcodes were also used to estimate allopatric divergences for selected species across broad geographical locations and found that Sphyrna lewini, Aetobatus narinari and Neotrygon kuhlii have cryptic diversity.},

title = {Resurrection of New Caledonian maskray Neotrygon trigonoides (Myliobatoidei: Dasyatidae) from synonymy with N. kuhlii, based on cytochrome-oxidase I gene sequences and spotting patterns},
abstract = {The maskray from New Caledonia, Neotrygon trigonoides Castelnau, 1873, has been recently synonymized with the blue-spotted maskray, N. kuhlii (Müller and Henle, 1841), a species with wide Indo-West Pacific distribution, but the reasons for this are unclear. Blue-spotted maskray specimens were collected from the Indian Ocean (Tanzania, Sumatra) and the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, Taiwan, and West Papua), and N. trigonoides specimens were collected from New Caledonia (Coral-Sea). Their partial COI gene sequences were generated to expand the available DNA-barcode database on this species, which currently comprises homologous sequences from Ningaloo Reef, the Coral Triangle and the Great Barrier Reef (Coral-Sea). Spotting patterns were also compared across regions. Haplotypes from the Coral-Sea formed a haplogroup phylogenetically distinct from all other haplotypes sampled in the Indo-West Pacific. No clear-cut geographic composition relative to DNA-barcodes or spotting patterns was apparent in N. kuhlii samples across the Indian Ocean and the Coral Triangle. The New Caledonian maskray had spotting patterns markedly different from all the other samples. This, added to a substantial level of net nucleotide divergence (2.6%) with typical N. kuhlii justifies considering the New Caledonian maskray as a separate species, for which we propose to resurrect the name Neotrygon trigonoides.},

title = {Identification of rays through DNA barcoding: an application for ecologists},
abstract = {DNA barcoding potentially offers scientists who are not expert taxonomists a powerful tool to support the accuracy of field studies involving taxa that are diverse and difficult to identify. The taxonomy of rays has received reasonable attention in Australia, although the fauna in remote locations such as Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia is poorly studied and the identification of some species in the field is problematic. Here, we report an application of DNA-barcoding to the identification of 16 species (from 10 genera) of tropical rays as part of an ecological study. Analysis of the dataset combined across all samples grouped sequences into clearly defined operational taxonomic units, with two conspicuous exceptions: the Neotrygon kuhlii species complex and the Aetobatus species complex. In the field, the group that presented the most difficulties for identification was the spotted whiptail rays, referred to as the ‘uarnak’ complex. Two sets of problems limited the successful application of DNA barcoding: (1) the presence of cryptic species, species complexes with unresolved taxonomic status and intra-specific geographical variation, and (2) insufficient numbers of entries in online databases that have been verified taxonomically, and the presence of lodged sequences in databases with inconsistent names. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the potential of the DNA barcoding approach to confirm field identifications and to highlight species complexes where taxonomic uncertainty might confound ecological data.},
